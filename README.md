# DragonflAI

DragonflAI is a novel way to implement, train and test artificial intelligence models. Similar to Keras for Tensorflow, it is thought to be an additional layer to the PyTorch API. 

DragonflAI API is based on a main experiment class that encapsulates all tools needed to create an AI model. To use more complex models, the user can override key functions during the training, the test, or the visualisation of an AI model.
